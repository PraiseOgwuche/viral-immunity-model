# Viral Infection and Immune Response Model Methodology

## 1. Model Overview

This document describes the mathematical and computational methods used to simulate viral infection dynamics and immune responses. The model incorporates four main components:
- Viral population (V)
- Infected cells (I)
- CD8+ T cells (T)
- Antibodies (A)

## 2. Biological Background

### 2.1 Viral Dynamics
- Viruses infect susceptible cells at rate β
- Infected cells produce new viruses at rate p
- Free viruses are cleared naturally at rate c
- Antibodies neutralize viruses at rate k_a

### 2.2 Immune Response
- T cells kill infected cells at rate k_t
- T cells proliferate in response to infection
- Antibody production is stimulated by viral presence
- Immune response has a delay (τ) for adaptive activation

## 3. Mathematical Model

### 3.1 System of ODEs

The dynamics are described by four coupled differential equations:

1. Viral Load (V):
```
dV/dt = p*I - c*V - k_a*A*V
```
- `p*I`: Production of new viruses by infected cells
- `c*V`: Natural clearance
- `k_a*A*V`: Antibody-mediated neutralization

2. Infected Cells (I):
```
dI/dt = β*V*(1-I/K) - δ*I - k_t*T*I
```
- `β*V*(1-I/K)`: Infection of cells with carrying capacity
- `δ*I`: Natural death of infected cells
- `k_t*T*I`: T cell-mediated killing

3. T Cells (T):
```
dT/dt = r*T*I/(θ+I) + s_t*I*T/(100+I) - d_t*T
```
- `r*T*I/(θ+I)`: Proliferation with saturation
- `s_t*I*T/(100+I)`: Additional stimulation
- `d_t*T`: Natural death

4. Antibodies (A):
```
dA/dt = s_a*V*T/(100+V) + 0.1*I - d_a*A
```
- `s_a*V*T/(100+V)`: Production stimulated by virus
- `0.1*I`: Additional stimulation from infected cells
- `d_a*A`: Natural decay

### 3.2 Parameter Definitions

| Parameter | Description | Units | Typical Range |

| β (beta) | Infection rate | virion^-1 day^-1 | 1e-8 to 1e-4 |
| δ (delta) | Infected cell death rate | day^-1 | 0.1 to 2.0 |
| p | Viral production rate | virion cell^-1 day^-1 | 1 to 1000 |
| c | Viral clearance rate | day^-1 | 0.1 to 10 |
| k_t | T cell killing rate | cell^-1 day^-1 | 1e-6 to 1e-2 |
| k_a | Antibody neutralization rate | molecule^-1 day^-1 | 1e-6 to 1e-2 |
| r | T cell proliferation rate | day^-1 | 0.1 to 5.0 |
| θ (theta) | Half-saturation constant | cells | 10 to 10000 |
